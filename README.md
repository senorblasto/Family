I will continue adding things that seem important enough to show the lawyer here, all 3 documents can be easily downloaded at the bottom


Note to self:  Find the case that was identical and Atzemis made ALL the same claims about CT scans/ X-rays that contradict the available literature.
## Good News

I've been having a real problem find good news to show you guys, I'm sure you've found the same... 
BUT I did find this story known as the Parker ruling

This family was in a similar situation where a baby had broken bones.  
They had to fight in court for 7 months, but they got their baby back.  The document is short and its worth reading how the case was dismissed.

## Presentation created by Atzemis ###

 Her own data shows that a broken femur is one of the **most** common bones for a baby to break, and that it is one of the **least** likely to be caused by abuse.  

 Chart shows that 30% of broken femurs are assumed to be caused by abuse, meanwhile 65% of broken ribs -Table on page 5

## Attorney in a Supreme Court case called into question Atzemis's credibility as a witness

#### "The Science Community recognizes **Dr. Atzemis'** field of expertize as "Junk Science,
" and that the testimony is contrary to the findings of the American Pediatrics Association (which she claims to quote from). Dr. Atzemis' testimony is ONLY to improperly "bolster" the testimony of the alleged victim and
to "give credibility" to the testimony given, not for substantial evidence to show proof of guilt."
