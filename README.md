## Attorney in a Supreme Court case called in to question Atzemis's credibility as a witness

#### "The Science Community recognizes **Dr. Atzemis'** field of expertize as "Junk Science,
" and that the testimony is contrary to the findings of the American Pediatrics Association (which she claims to quote from). Dr. Atzemis' testimony is ONLY to improperly "bolster" the testimony of the alleged victim and
to "give credibility" to the testimony given, not for substantial evidence to show proof of guilt."
